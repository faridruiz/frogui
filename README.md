## Introduction
**Frogui** is a proof-of-concept framework that allows developers familiar with C# and Visual Studio to build native client *web apps* using their existing skills, with no need to learn or use JavaScript or other web technologies.

## Contributing
This repo currently contains samples to use with Frogui, all neatly organized in a Visual Studio solution [here](https://github.com/lesarde-co/frogui/tree/master/Samples). Your contributions are welcomed! Here are some ideas:

- Compare performance of native C## to JavaScript
- Port classic console-based apps such as adventure games, painting images using text, etc.
- Anything you can imagine!
